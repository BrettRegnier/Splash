## Introduction
I've made this originally because I kept forgetting to water my geranium and it was beginning to wilt. So, of course, being a computer scientist I fixed this in the laziest, but also the most complicated technology related way I could. I built a simple sensor project using an ardruino that pumped water into the flower pot until the sensors detected water and then shut off. 

I've now move foward into evolving the project to report statistics to a python server, and I plan to continue making it better over time.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
