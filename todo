-- The plant should be watered based on the detected moisure level 
        instead of the digital detection, therefore depending on the plant
        it can be adjusted.
    --Make watering based on the analog levels instead of the digital levels or 
        at least both.
            -Need to rethink completely how I am doing the reading loops.

-- multiple sensor moisure readings.

-- Add an LED to blink when the resevoir is out of water (not a priority)

-- Features:
    On the website the server can be told (the changes will occur once every time it reconnects)
        -at what moisture level should be watered.
        -how many times to water in 1 day.
        -how frequently to check the water levels. (needs a min and max?)
        -Different sensors have different informations on the site?

        -Temperature monitor?
