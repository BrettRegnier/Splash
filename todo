Client:
    -- Register plants to a resevoir?
        -- alternatively, the plant knows it resevoir pin

    -- Check water level of resevoir and report it.
        -add the current level of resevoir to the website in the water wheel and stats
        
    -- Add an LED to blink when the resevoir is out of water (not a priority)
    
    -- Temperature monitor?   
    -- average water consumption

Web:
    -- Features:
        -The water meter should have both the current (small line) and the previous value (thicc line)
            -on mouse hover/click place ontop and display the value inside of the circle.
            -add legend
        -On the website the server can be told (the changes will occur once every time it reconnects)
            1. Name of plant
            2. Moisture level to water at
            3. How many times a day (frequency)
            4. Range of acceptable times to water
            5. Detect type
            6. Timezone
            7. Pump duration.
        
    -- Graphs - chart.js
        - day, week, month, choose between date periods

    -- Add in loading screen so that people know that it is querying? (sort of done)
    
    -- Add in resizing for both?

Circuit: 
    -- Switch to using a mosfets
    -- Add multiplexer
    -- For the emulated voltage sensor, I need to have the two prongs as close together has possible pretty much touching.
        otherwise they are unstable.
3D Model:
    -- make a 3d model that can encase the prongs that go into the ground, the top should be able to be popped off so a replacement can happen as well, as wires to be added
    -- make it modular like lego blocks with holes.
