    -- The code will need to change based on the clock speed of the esp module.
    -- average water consumption


    -- Check water level of resevoir and report it.
        -add the current level of resevoir to the website in the water wheel and stats
        
    -- Make class for a "plant" and have the values stored there so I can make it have multiple 
        plants on one device.

    -- Add an LED to blink when the resevoir is out of water (not a priority)
    -- Temperature monitor?   
    
    -- Get the maximum analog amount and compress the values by the value to get a percentage to reduce useless calculations.

Web:
    -- Features:
        -The water meter should have both the current (small line) and the previous value (thicc line)
            -on mouse hover/click place ontop and display the value inside of the circle.
            -add legend
        -On the website the server can be told (the changes will occur once every time it reconnects)
            1. Name of plant
            2. Moisture level to water at
            3. How many times a day (frequency)
            4. Range of acceptable times to water
            5. Detect type
            6. Timezone
            7. Pump duration.
        
    -- Graphs - chart.js
        - day, week, month, choose between date periods

    -- Add in loading screen so that people know that it is querying? (sort of done)

Circuit: 
    -- Switch to using a mosfets and capacitor sensors
    -- Add multiplexer


Arctic TODO <--------------------
    -- Make sure this code is arctic ready in the Readme
